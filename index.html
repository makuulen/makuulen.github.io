      <span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Why are flamingos pink?</span><br/><br/>
      The pink or red color of the flamingo's plumage is given by coloring substances obtained from food. In case of danger, the birds fly up in a flock, and it is difficult for the predator to choose a particular victim from them, especially since the flight feathers on the wings are always black and when flying, they prevent you from focusing your eyes on the victim.
       Their pink color comes from small red crustaceans, which contain carotenoid.
